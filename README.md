## Features
---

### Navbar

 -  

 - 

 - 

### Home

 - 

 - 
 - 

 - 
### Login

 - when user clicks the Cafes it shows three option as Dublin2,6,8. When the user clicks the Dublin 2, the pages show 5 cafes reviews. There is a cafes image with a moving card contain a short review with a link button inside the image. Use card hover effect to give better motion on the pages. In Dublin 6, there are two cafe images and the same card hover effect. Same effect on Dublin 8 with 5 cafes image. Try to minimise the layout and appearance of pages to give a clear idea of the website and focus on user interaction with the card hover effect. 

### Top3

 - this page is the top3 suggestion for different category cafe.  Three cafes are ranked in my personal opinion.  The purpose of the page is that user can reduce the searching time, instantly decide what they look for. I use a simple hover effect when the mouse affects each row to give friendly interaction with the user.

### Contact

 - simple layout for the contact form contains with coffee image and the user can send full name and email address as well as message. The form will be sent to my email address ( I used [emailJS](www.emailjs.com) and when the user sent the form, the user will get the alert that they have sent the message. 

### Footer

 - footer allocated to the bottom of each page, So when the user finished scrolling down, they always expected to see the footer. Footer is contained about which linked the about page on my blog explain about the cafe review and beside the about, there are social media links. So they will help to get extra information about the website and user can find another way to communicate with icoffeemap website. 



## Existing Features
---

There are many existing cafe review website online. I wanted to create a website that simple and easy to find the info as well as having some fun with it too. My website has two big sections as functionally. One is to offer cafe information and recommend the cafes. The second is interacting with the user through coffee quiz and search form.  


### HOME

I already mentioned most of the existing feature above paragraph. Additionally, the navbar and footer help to navigate the whole website and with a media query, the website has better look and clear appearance. There are no about info shows on the footer on mobile size device. Its design gives a simple look for a small device. The same information can check on one of the image cards which is linked to my cafe review blog. 


### CAFES(Dublin 2,6,8 Pages)

same function as the home page about navbar and footer. Simple image card hovers effect with linked button in it. 


### TOP3

simple image card with the linked button on the bottom of the image. When the user moves mouse each row, not chosen image row get less opacity. In that way, the website can interact with the user. 


### CONTACT

Try that user get reacted after message sent. So, the user can be sure that it worked okay. 


### QUESTIONS

There are three questions with options to choose from. after the question, the user would get best-fit cafes from the choice made. There are cancel options all the form right corner and go next and back as well as finish function on them. 

### COFFEEQUIZ

There are four quizzes with timer function and progress bar and shows the correct answer with green colour and orange colour with the wrong answer. End of the quiz gets the percentage of quiz answer result with friendly image and comments. 



## Features left to implement
---

 - Many functions can be improved. For instance, it would be better that there is a search bar on the right corner of the navbar, so user can easily search regardless of cafe name or location. 

 - As an increase in popularity and user traffic, it would be a good idea to put dark mode that user can easier read on their device.

 - More cafe lists need to update and the exiting cafe review list should be up-to-date information to be served as possible as accurate information.

## Testing 
---

 - Forms testing: 
 
There are two sections to form the test. The first one is getting users information form such as ‘newsletter’ and ‘Contact’. Moreover, there are two quiz's form such as ‘Find your cafe( questions)’ and ‘coffee quiz’. To ensure the website was functioning as it should, I tested each of the forms on different devices and browsers. 

1. Newsletter
This form is asking the visitor to sign up for a new update by registering their email. There is an email input box and send button below. When user input their email address, I got the data through my email account which I register on ‘emailjs’ 

    texting form data used the [link](https://www.emailjs.com). Also, after the user submits the email, there are confirm popup on the window that confirmation message to the user that the data sent successfully. 

2. Contact
This form is required three sections to fill up to submit an optional message. When the user submits the info with submit button, the data come to my registered account and show a confirmed message on the windows popup. Texting form data used the [link](https://www.emailjs.com).

3. Find your cafe(questions)

User can find this form button on the home page inside the carousel. When the button clicked there is a new window open and one with a start button and three questions boxes and a result box at last. This form contains a close button on the right corner of each box and an options button with ‘Next’’Back’’Finish’ as a user can navigate the questions as to their desire. Credit to [this link](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS2-inspiry-tokyo).

Each button tested and all button works as it was designed for. Originally it supposed to pop up inside my home page. I made a separate page to do the question form. The reason is there are many functions on the home page includes a slideshow, coffee quiz and map etc. I want to more clear and less traffic on one page.

4.  Coffeequiz

This form is asking user four questions about coffee and shows the scoring base on the users have tested. There are thirteen buttons altogether. The first one with the start button and three option buttons each with four questions. I tested all and work. The quiz contained with timer and four counters with is working according to the code. The result shows with the percentage work with counters and the image and comments change according to the percentage. All works.

#### Project bug and solution

  - bug1

![bug1](assets/docs/images/bug/bug1.png)

          This bug occurred in mobile views. I couldn't figure out the margin issue with the footer. Which supposed to fixed on the centre in various mobile devices. I got help from tutor and media query I rid of pull-right from CSS style and add margin 10 auto to make the centre. The bug fixed.




  - bug2
  
  ![bug2](assets/docs/images/bug/bug2.png)

         This bug occurred on tablet view. I add min-width 250 and with a media query, I add another CSS to be min-width 200, also adjusted margin size. it got fixed

  - bug3 

  ![bug3](assets/docs/images/bug/bug3.png)

         On question.js, the suggested (model4) kept shows on the bottom of the question, I realized that I made mistake in spelling (model-split->modal-split). Fixed.

  - bug4

  ![bug4](assets/docs/images/bug/bug4.png)

          On question.js, the function didn't work and it shows an error and I realized that suggestions should be more option to fit the function requirement. Because there are only 12 objects, some of the options doesn't fit with a suggestion. I add more cafes on suggestions, so the function has more flexibility to run. 


  - bug5

          All the images had big size, which delayed loading time. My mentor advised me to compress all the image size. I used [this site]((https://tinyjpg.com/)) to compress all the images and test on my old laptop. it loads faster than before.

## Deployment
---
    1) Firstly I create the account part of my CSS course on code institute. After practising the mini-project, I could get the idea to use Gitpod as well as GitHub. I created a new repository to start my project and put the name  “milestone-project1”

    2) After getting my repository for my project I start work all coding and update all my files on Gitpod. 

    3) Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project. 

    4) Each day when I finished, I save the data and when all the work was done, I went to Github pages and check the setting menu and found the Github pages. I selected the Master Branch and it automatically creates a URL address. 

    5) To access the code, I can get a clone that provides an URL and I can use my phone or any device, or download it as a zip file on the device.
