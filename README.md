    -- 



  - Typography : Typography : I used Google Fonts to get some idea of my website fonts and decided to use “ ‘Poppins” and “Sans-serif” as the backup font. I choose Poppins because it looks more followed trend as modern and minimalism at the same time it looks friendly and reliable.


  - Icons :Icons : Font Awesome was my choice to use all icons on my website. I used mainly footer social icon, top3 page heading icons. Try to use icons that easy to understand the purpose of usage.

7) [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) - The project uses Flask, which is a Python microframework.

8) [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) - The project uses Jinja for templating with Flask in the HTML code. I used Jinja to simplify my HTML code, avoid repetition, and allow simpler linking of the back-end to the front-end.

9) PyMongo - The project uses PyMongo as the Python API for MongoDB. This API enables linking the data from the back-end database to the front-end app.
